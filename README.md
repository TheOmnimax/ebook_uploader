# Ebook uploader

This is a very basic app simply used to upload new EPUB files to the server for use by the [Thali eReader](https://github.com/TheOmnimax/ereader) app. Since it is only used internally, it isn't that pretty, but it does what is needed.

## Upload an ebook

### Part 1: Log in

You need to be logged in to upload EPUB files. If you do not have credentials yet, you can create them from the [Thali eReader](https://github.com/TheOmnimax/ereader) app.

1. Tap the three-line menu in the upper-left.
2. If it says your username, you are all set, and you can move on to part 2. Otherwise, tap *Log in*.
3. Enter your username and password, then tap *Log in*.

### Part 2: Upload the ebook

To upload a new EPUB file to the server, once you are logged in, simply follow these steps:

1. Tap *Select file*.
2. If it asks for storage permission, tap *Allow*.
3. Select the EPUB file.
4. Click *Upload file*.

When it says "201: The file was added successfully!", it means the upload was successful, and it will be listed as a downloadable ebook from the Thali eReader app.
